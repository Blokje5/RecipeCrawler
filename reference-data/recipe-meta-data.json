            "description": "Whoever submitted this recipe deserves high honors and awards galore!! The sauce is what makes or breaks the flavor of a pasta dish. This meat sauce is the best that I have ever eaten, never the less fixed myself, and the absolute first recipe I ever wanted to rate. The only adjustment I made was I used a 25oz can of diced tomatoes that already had garlic, basil and oregano in it. It was the only large can of tomatoes I had in the pantry and I didn\u2019t want to make a trip back to the store. I still used the seasonings and amount listed for the recipe and I had the reg diced tomatoes in the 15oz can. I don\u2019t know how much of a difference it actually made, but the meat sauce itself was excellent. I read all the reviews before I cooked this and I absolutely have to agree with the reviewer who stressed to make sure you simmer the sauce for the full 30 minutes. Not only are the seasonings blending but it also helps the sauce to thicken. I\u2019m one who really doesn\u2019t like sugar in pasta sauce, but stick to this recipe! I used a little over 2 tablespoons and it didn\u2019t make the sauce taste sweet. If anything it balanced the overall flavor. For this to be the Best Lasagna that you will ever make - stick to the recipe! No extra salt needed!! At least for the first time you try this recipe - don\u2019t change a thing if you don\u2019t have to. Follow the directions exactly. Then the next time if you honestly feel you need to change something - do it then. I just doubt you\u2019ll change anything - it\u2019s that spectacular!!! Thanks for this recipe!!!!!",

I used a 9x9 baking dish, which was just enough for myself and my husband.  1lb of ground beef and 1lb of mild Italian sausage was a perfect balance.  This Was definitely MY BEST LASAGNA!!! 5 stars for me ??",

            "description": "This is really a great basic lasagna recipe. I gave it a 4 because I made a few small adjustments that I think enhanced the dish. First, more salt. I find most online recipes to be under seasoned. I typically cook my noodles in heavily salted water but I used \"oven ready\" noodles so I needed extra salt. Also, homemade tomato sauces always need extra salt. Also, I threw in a small pinch of red pepper flakes. I dislike spicy sensation but I find red pepper flakes just kicks up the flavor a notch. I LOVED how this this lasagna was, how it held up when cut and serves, and how thick and meaty everything was. LOVE the amount of cheese! We fed 4 adults and 5 kids with 3 large leftover portions with this!",
